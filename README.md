# Flashy-dashy

A Python application that helps users learn new words in a foreign language using flashcards. It utilizes the `tkinter` library for building the user interface and the `pandas` library for loading and manipulating data from a CSV file.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd repo-name`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage

1. When the application is launched, it displays a flashcard with a French word on the front and an English translation on the back.
2. Click the "Known" button if you know the word, or the "Unknown" button if you don't.
3. If you click the "Known" button, the word will be removed from the list and the application will display a new word.
4. If you click the "Unknown" button, the application will display the translation and wait for the next input.
5. Repeat the process until you have learned all the words.
